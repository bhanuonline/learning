**BubbleSort**
* Outer loop runs n−1 times
* Inner loop runs n−i−1 times to ensure comparisons are only made on the unsorted part of the array
* Arrays.sort() method or Collections.sort() for their optimized performance
* Time complexity estimates how many basic operations (like comparisons or swaps) the algorithm performs as n increases.
* Big-O Notation : Used to describe the growth rate of the algorithm O(n2)
