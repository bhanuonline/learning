**What is Maven?**

Dependency Management: Automatically downloading and managing libraries or JAR files required for your project.
Build Automation: Compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying your code
Lifecycle Management: Managing the phases of software build and deployment.

**Generate a Maven Project**
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    
    -DgroupId: Group ID for your project (like a package name).
    -DartifactId: Name of your project.
    -DarchetypeArtifactId: Specifies the template for the project. maven-archetype-quickstart is a basic Java project template.
    -DinteractiveMode=false: Skips interactive prompts.

**Understand the pom.xml**

The pom.xml (Project Object Model) is the heart of a Maven project. It includes:

Project Information: Name, version, etc.
Dependencies: External libraries your project needs.
Plugins: Tools for compiling, testing, or packaging the project.

**Build and Run the Project**

mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package
mvn install


**Maven Build Lifecycle**

Maven organizes the build process into three main lifecycles:

    Clean: Cleans up the project by removing temporary files (e.g., target folder).
    Default: The main lifecycle for building the project. It includes phases like compiling, testing, and packaging.
    Site: Handles the generation of project documentation


    Maven defines a standard lifecycle for building and deploying projects. It includes several phases:

    clean: Cleans up the output from previous builds (e.g., mvn clean).
    Default :
    validate: Checks if the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
    compile: Compiles the source code into bytecode.
    test: Runs the unit tests.
    package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
    verify: Verifies the package is valid and meets quality standards.
    install: Installs the package into the local Maven repository.
    deploy: Deploys the final package to a remote repository or server.

**Clean Lifecycle**

The clean lifecycle is designed for cleaning the project and removing any previously compiled artifacts (like class files or JARs). It typically runs before the build starts to ensure that no old files are left behind.

        pre-clean: Execute any actions needed before the clean phase.
        clean: Remove the files generated by the previous build.
        post-clean: Execute any actions needed after the clean phase.


Key Phases in the Default Lifecycle

    Phase	    Description	                                                                    Command
    validate    Validates the project structure and configuration.	                                mvn validate
    compile	    Compiles the source code.	mvn compile
    test	    Runs the unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG.	                mvn test
    package	    Packages the compiled code into a deployable artifact (e.g., .jar, .war).	        mvn package
    verify	    Verifies the package against integration tests or quality checks.	mvn verify
    install	    Installs the package to your local Maven repository for use by other projects.	mvn install
    deploy	    Copies the package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers.	mvn deploy

**Maven Plugins**

Plugins add extra functionality to Maven builds, such as custom compile configurations, running tests, and generating reports
mvn compile

Maven Surefire Plugin

mvn test

<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.0.0-M7</version>
</plugin>

Running Maven Commands
mvn clean : Deletes the target directory.

**mvn compile** :Compiles the Java source code in src/main/java.This command compiles the project's source code and stores the compiled classes in the target/classes directory.
    
    Resolve any necessary dependencies (if not already present).
    Compile the source code found in src/main/java (e.g., HelloWorld.java).
    Store the compiled bytecode in the target/classes folder.
    Does not run tests or package the application
    
    How to Configure the Compiler Version (Optional)
    You can specify the version of the Java compiler to use in the pom.xml file by configuring the maven-compiler-plugin. This can be helpful if you want to compile the project with a specific version of Java.
    
    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.8.1</version>
          <configuration>
            <source>11</source>
            <target>11</target>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>


mvn test: Executes the unit tests in src/test/java.

mvn package : Creates a JAR/WAR file in the target directory
mvn install : installs the JAR/WAR to the local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository).
mvn deploy :Pushes the artifact to a remote Maven repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory).
mvn clean install
mvn clean generate-sources -X
mvn site .If you want to generate documentation (reports, Javadoc, etc. This will generate the site for your project and create a set of reports in the target/site/
