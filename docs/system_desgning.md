**What is System Design?**
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data flow of a system to meet specific requirements

**Why is System Design Important?**
Scalability: Ensures the system can handle growing amounts of work or users.
Reliability: Guarantees the system performs consistently, even under high loads or failures.
Performance: Ensures low latency and high throughput.
Maintainability: Makes it easy to add new features or fix bugs.
Cost-effectiveness: Balances performance with cost

**Types of System Design**

#### High-Level System Design (HLD):

Focuses on the big picture.
Defines the overall architecture, major components, and how they interact.
Example: Designing a distributed system for an e-commerce application.

#### Low-Level System Design (LLD):

Focuses on the detailed design of individual components.
Defines class diagrams, algorithms, and data structures.
Example: Defining the database schema or API endpoints.

**Scalability:**

What: How well a system can handle increased load.

Types:
**Vertical Scaling:** Add more power to a single server (e.g., more CPU, RAM).

**Horizontal Scaling:** Add more servers to handle the load.

Example: Scaling an e-commerce website for Black Friday traffic.
